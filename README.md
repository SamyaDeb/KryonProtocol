## What is Kryon?

Kryon is a perpetual-futures DEX that pairs an **on-chain margin engine and settlement layer** (eight Soroban smart contracts) with an **off-chain central-limit order book matcher**, giving traders a familiar low-latency perp experience without giving up self-custody.

- **Launch market:** `XLM-PERP`, quoted and settled in **USDC** (BTC-PERP and ETH-PERP market configs are ready to enable)
- **Leverage:** up to 10× with 1000bps initial margin on the launch market
- **Custody:** collateral never leaves the on-chain vault; the matcher can only settle orders traders have signed
- **Network:** Stellar **mainnet** — live in production since 2026-07-07

Traders sign order intents with [Freighter](https://freighter.app), the matcher pairs them price-time priority, and every fill is settled on-chain through the order gateway into a single volume-weighted position per (trader, market).

### On-chain (Soroban contracts, Rust `#![no_std]`)

| Contract | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `perp-vault` | SEP-41 collateral custody, internal balances, risk-gated withdrawals |
| `perp-engine` | Position lifecycle, execution price bands, OI caps, fees, funding indexes, realized PnL settlement |
| `perp-order-gateway` | Settlement entry point for matched fills — nonce tracking, overfill protection, self-trade rejection, cancellations |
| `perp-oracle-adapter` | Guarded price snapshots: publisher auth, staleness checks, quorum medianization, deviation bounds |
| `perp-liquidation` | Account-health liquidation executor with capped rewards and bad-debt recording |
| `perp-insurance` | Insurance fund custody, rewards, bad-debt accounting |
| `perp-risk` | Thin Soroban boundary around the pure Rust risk engine |
| `perp-governance` | Timelock proposal registry and guardian pause control |

The authorisation graph is strict: `Engine.open_position` requires the order gateway, `Vault.apply_pnl` requires the engine, and end-user signatures are required only where users spend their own funds (deposit/withdraw) or revoke their own orders (cancel).

### Off-chain services

| Service | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Matcher** | Deterministic CLOB with price-time priority, partial fills, replace priority reset, market-order walking — settles fills on-chain via operator-signed `settle_fill` |
| **Oracle keeper** | Publishes the median of Binance/Coinbase/Kraken on-chain every ~8s (≥2 sources required, deviation + USDC-depeg guards) |
| **State indexer** | Syncs on-chain positions, OI, funding, and stats to Postgres; computes leaderboard/portfolio analytics |
| **WebSocket server** | Real-time orderbook and trade broadcast |
| **Settlement reconciler** | Recovers stuck/queued settlement transactions |
| **Liquidation keeper** | Scans accounts, liquidates underwater positions, and runs the contract TTL keepalive |
| **Monitor** | Alerting for stale oracle, bad debt, settlement failures, liquidation backlog |

### Protocol invariants (non-negotiable)

1. Withdrawals are validated against **current account equity**, not stored locked margin.
2. Liquidations are **account-health based**; position-local liquidation only for explicit isolated margin.
3. Funding derives from market imbalance or independent mark/index divergence — never oracle minus itself.
4. Every oracle read carries source, timestamp, confidence, and freshness bounds.
5. Insurance/SLP accounting must reconcile to vault custody plus known unsettled liabilities.
6. Upgrade authority is protocol risk: governance delay plus emergency limits.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (client) · Node 20+ works too
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) with the workspace toolchain (protocol, optional)
- [Freighter](https://freighter.app) wallet — set to **Stellar Testnet** for local development (the deployed app at [kryonprotocol.vercel.app](https://kryonprotocol.vercel.app) runs on **Stellar Mainnet**)
- A Neon (or any) Postgres database
- Desktop / large screen (≥ 1024 px) — the terminal is desktop-first

> Local dev defaults to testnet contracts (see the collapsed testnet table above) so you can test with faucet funds. To point a local instance at mainnet, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_*` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` env vars to the mainnet values instead.

### 1. Run the client

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Create `client/.env` (Next.js) **and** `client/.env.local` (off-chain scripts read this):

```ini
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://…neon.tech/db?sslmode=require"   # Postgres
ORACLE_PUBLISHER_SECRET="S…"                                 # authorized oracle publisher key
```

```bash
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000  →  /trade/XLM-PERP
```

Order and market data flows through the app's own same-origin `/api` routes — no separate matcher/indexer URL is needed.

### 2. Run the off-chain services (live prices & fills)

```bash
npm run dev:oracle       # publish XLM price on-chain (~8s cadence)
npm run dev:matcher      # match orders + settle fills on-chain
npm run dev:indexer      # sync on-chain state → DB
npm run dev:ws           # WebSocket server (orderbook + trades)
npm run dev:reconciler   # recover stuck settlement transactions
npm run dev:liquidator   # liquidate underwater positions + contract TTL keepalive
```

A PM2 ecosystem file (`client/ecosystem.config.cjs`) and Docker Compose / Render configs are provided for running the service fleet in the cloud.

### 3. Build the protocol (optional)

```bash
cd kryon-protocol
cargo build --workspace
cargo test  --workspace
```

## Routes

| Route | Page |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Landing page |
| `/trade/[market]` | Trading terminal (e.g. `/trade/XLM-PERP`) |
| `/portfolio` | Account overview — balances, positions, history |
| `/leaderboard` | Trader rankings |
| `/markets` | Market list |
| `/docs` | Full engineering documentation (Docusaurus) |

### API surface

REST endpoints are Next.js route handlers under `client/app/api/**`: `orders` (submit/cancel), `fills`, `funding`, `markets`, `portfolio`, `leaderboard`, `settlements`, plus `health` and `ready` probes. The WebSocket contract and full request/response schemas are documented in the [API reference](https://kryonprotocol.vercel.app/docs/api/rest).

## Testing & verification

| Suite | Command | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol unit + invariants | `cargo test --workspace` | Math, risk engine, contracts, matcher determinism |
| Client unit | `npm test` | Price/size precision, market config, order-intent encoding, collateral maths |
| Production gate | `npm run production:gate` | Config completeness before deploy |
| Live gate | `npm run production:live-gate` | Live deployment health validation |

End-to-end, load, soak and failure-recovery harnesses drive live testnet and
mainnet deployments with real keys and real orders. They are operator tooling,
not part of the shipped product, and are deliberately excluded from this
repository.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`):

- **`ci.yml`** — client lint, typecheck, `npm audit`, production gate, build, plus protocol Rust checks on PRs and pushes to `main`
- **`deploy-production.yml`** — auto-deploys the client to Cloudflare Workers (via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` + `wrangler`) on pushes to `main` (paths `client/**`) after a readiness gate
- **`deploy-client.yml`** — manual Vercel deployment pipeline (legacy/fallback); production deploys require `confirm_mainnet=mainnet`
- **`mainnet-preflight.yml`** — manual mainnet gate requiring every contract, asset, app, websocket, database, and signer secret to be configured (passed for the 2026-07-07 mainnet launch; reused for future mainnet redeploys)
- **`production-validation.yml`** — validates the live app: security headers, readiness, core APIs, websocket reconnect storms, market-data soak, and required E2E evidence links
- **`codeql.yml`** + **`dependency-review.yml`** + Dependabot — static security analysis and weekly dependency updates

```

Worker **runtime** secrets (`DATABASE_URL`, `MATCHER_OPERATOR_SECRET`, `UPSTASH_*`) are set once with `wrangler secret put`, never through CI.

**Live-validation variables**

```ini
WALLET_E2E_EVIDENCE_URL     OBSERVABILITY_DASHBOARD_URL   LIVE_GATE_MARKET_ID
TRADING_E2E_EVIDENCE_URL    INCIDENT_RUNBOOK_URL          ROLLBACK_RUNBOOK_URL
```

</details>

## Security

- **Trusted-operator settlement:** the matcher operator can only settle fills that both traders have signed; it cannot invent positions, move collateral, or bypass price bands, expiry, cancellation, overfill, or self-trade checks enforced on-chain.
- **Guarded oracle:** publisher authorization, publish-time staleness rejection, monotonic replay rejection, confidence checks, quorum medianization with three-source minimum, and source-deviation bounds.
- **Two-step admin transfer** on all contracts holding privileged config roles; governance timelock plus guardian pause.
- **Audits:** internal audit reports (including a mainnet-implementation audit) live in [`Audit Reports/`](Audit%20Reports/). All flagged high/critical findings were fixed and the contracts redeployed.
- Precision model: prices and PnL use 1e18 fixed-point; USDC amounts use 1e7 (Stellar stroop-equivalent) — all math is checked, deterministic, and dependency-light.

The full threat model and trust assumptions are documented in [Security](https://kryonprotocol.vercel.app/docs/security).

## Documentation

The complete engineering reference — architecture, trade lifecycle, PnL & funding math, database schema, REST/WebSocket APIs, runbooks, and mainnet-readiness analysis — is built with Docusaurus from [`docs/`](docs/) and served at [/docs](https://kryonprotocol.vercel.app/docs) on the live deployment.

```bash
cd docs && npm install && npm start   # local docs at http://localhost:3000
```

## Status & roadmap

Kryon is **live on Stellar mainnet** as of 2026-07-07 — all eight contracts deployed and wired, the `XLM-PERP` market configured (10× leverage, guardian pause armed, $500 USDC deposit cap while ramping), and the frontend, matcher, oracle keeper, indexer, and liquidation keeper all running against production. The full release suite is validated on testnet before every release; a mainnet tiny-trade E2E drill is the last item before the deposit cap is lifted. Admin authority is transferring to the `perp-governance` timelock (48h delay) as the final hardening step — see the [mainnet-readiness checklist](https://kryonprotocol.vercel.app/docs/mainnet-readiness) for the full launch runbook.
